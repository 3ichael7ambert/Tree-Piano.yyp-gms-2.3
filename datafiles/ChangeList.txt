Version 1.0.1:

- Fixed a critical memory leak where segments weren't getting deleted properly

	(oSegment > Step)
	Added following step event:
	///Update segments
	if (endX < view_xview[0] - 300)
	{
    		// destroy when out of view
    		instance_destroy();
	}

Version 1.0.2:

- Fixed the view when running on mobile in portrait mode

	(Script > InitialiseControl)
	Changed line 13 and 14 to:
	winHeight = view_hview[0];
	winWidth = view_wview[0];
	
	-------

	(Script > GetNextHillPosition)
	Additional fix for endless loop issue created by above fix. Change line 10 to:
	if(ny < window_get_height()-paddingTop && ny > paddingBottom)

- Added coins (new object - oCoin)

	(Script > CreateHillPoint)
	Added logic to decide if point gets coins
	// Decide if this hill point gets coins
	// Make sure we dont check an undefined hill point
	if (oControl.hillPoints[| totalHills-1] != undefined)
	{   
	    	// random chance and going down (first part of hill)
    		if ((random(10)> 8) and dir = -1)
    		{
  	      		// Set this part to have coins
   	     		inst.hasCoins = true;
   	     		// Set next part to have coins
  	      		nextHasCoins = true;
   	 }
   	 		// if we're now on the second part
   	 	else if (nextHasCoins)
  	  	{
    	    		// This part also has coins
   	     		inst.hasCoins = true;
   	     		// Reset this flag
   	     		nextHasCoins = false;
   	 	}
	}

	Added coin creation at line 31
	// If this hill point gets coins
    	if (hasCoins)
    	{
        	// Add them to each segment
        	instance_create(point0X, point0Y -20, oCoin); 
    	}
